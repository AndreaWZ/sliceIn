        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>
            Color (American English), or colour (Commonwealth English), is 
            the characteristic of visual perception described through color 
            categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, 
            or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation 
            of photoreceptor cells (in particular cone cells in the human eye 
            and other vertebrate eyes) by electromagnetic radiation (in the 
            visible spectrum in the case of humans). Color categories and 
            physical specifications of color are associated with objects through 
            the wavelengths of the light that is reflected from them and their 
            intensities. This reflection is governed by the object's physical 
            properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

            By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically 
            by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement 
            with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above 
            (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination. 
            The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding 
            to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond 
            to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm 
            (red); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm (green); and 
            short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm (blue).[1][2] There may also 
            be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as 
            in the CMYK color model, wherein one of the dimensions relates to 
            a color's colorfulness). <img class="images2" src="images/img2.jpeg"/>

            The photo-receptivity of the "eyes" of other species also varies 
            considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly 
            different color perceptions that cannot readily be compared to 
            one another. <img class="images3" src="images/img3.jpeg"/>Honey bees and bumblebees have trichromatic color 
            vision sensitive to ultraviolet but insensitive to red. Papilio 
            butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have 
            pentachromatic vision.[3] The most complex color vision system 
            in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the 
            mantis shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to 
            work as multiple dichromatic units.

            The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, 
            or simply color science. It includes the study of the perception 
            of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, 
            color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation 
            in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as light).
